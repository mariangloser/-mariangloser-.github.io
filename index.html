            <p><center>
            My name is Mari치n Gloser, a 21 year old from Slovakia and I am a 3rd year student at Bocconi University studying Mathematics for AI. My interests include
            Analysis, Number Theory, Coding and Computer Science and writing maths papers in free time. Other interests include playing
            the piano, drawing and walking.

            <p><center>
            This was the first paper I have ever written, I was 15 years old at the time. As one can imagine, there is nothing
            groundbreaking about this paper, but it provides a solid foundation in irrational numbers for those interested with some
            prerequisite mathematical background.

            <p><center>
            This is a fun paper I wrote just to collect some neat ideas I had throughout highschool. The theorems are in no way connected
            to one another but rather are supposed to be often overlooked in each respective area, while still being used a lot or having
            great applications.

            <p><center>
            This was a huge leap for me in terms of my mathematical achievements. I derived a closed formula (albeit not very useful)
            for a notorious sum which was solved first time by Jacob Bernoulli. I used a very different and new approach to derive the
            formula.
